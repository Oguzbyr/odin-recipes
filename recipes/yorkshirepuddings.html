    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <ul>
        <li> 4
            large eggs</li>
        <li>1 1⁄2
            cups whole milk </li>
        <li>1⁄2
            teaspoon coarse salt </li>
        <li>1 1⁄4
            cups all-purpose flour </li>
        <li>4
            tablespoons vegetable oil (or beef drippings) </li>

        <h1> Steps</h1>

        <ol>
            <li>In a blender, combine the eggs, milk, flour, and salt. Blend until well combined and place in the
                refrigerator until ready to use (allow to rest for at least 30 minutes). </li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 425°F. </li>
            <li>Put 1 teaspoon of the oil (or beef drippings) into each section of a 12-hole Yorkshire pudding tray or
                muffin tray and put into the oven on the top shelf until very hot, almost smoking. </li>
            <li>As soon as you take the tray from the oven, pour in the batter to three-quarters fill the tins (it
                should sizzle) and immediately put back into the oven. </li>
            <li>Bake until the Yorkshire puddings are well risen, golden brown and crisp, 15 to 20 minutes. Don't open
                the oven door until the end or they might collapse. </li>
