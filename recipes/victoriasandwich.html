    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <ul>
        <h2><em> For the Cake </em></h2>
        <li>225 grams very soft unsalted butter (plus extra for greasing tins) </li>
        <li>225 grams plus another 1-2 teaspoons caster sugar </li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract </li>
        <li>200 grams plain flour </li>
        <li>25 grams cornflour </li>
        <li>2½ teaspoons baking powder (plus another ½ teaspoon if making in a processor) </li>
        <li>a pinch of salt </li>
        <li>4 large eggs (at room temperature) </li>
        <li>2 - 3 x 15ml tablespoons milk (at room temperature) </li>
        <h2> <em> For the Filling </em> </h2>

        <li>75 grams - or as desired - seedless raspberry jam </li>
        <li>150 grams fresh raspberries </li>
        <li>150 millilitres double cream </li>
    </ul>

    <h1> Steps</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat the oven to 180°C/160°C Fan/350°F. Grease the sides of the tins with a small amount of butter and line
            the bases with baking parchment. </li>
        <li>ou can make the sponge with a processor – in which case just blitz all the ingredients together (except for
            the 2 teaspoons of sugar and the milk) including the extra half-teaspoon of baking powder, until you have a
            smooth batter, and then, with the motor running, pour in 2 tablespoons of the milk slowly down the funnel
            until the mixture has a soft, dropping consistency, adding the third tablespoon only if necessary — or you
            can make it with an electric mixer and, indeed, the old-fashioned way, by hand; and if either of those is
            this case, start by creaming the butter and sugar, that’s to say, beating them vigorously together until
            very light and fluffy. Add the teaspoon of vanilla extract and beat that in, too. </li>
        <li>In another, smaller, bowl mix together the flour, cornflour, baking powder and salt.
        </li>
        <li>Beat one egg into the creamed butter and sugar, followed by one tablespoon of the flour mixture and, once
            both are absorbed, continue in this manner until all 4 eggs are used up. Give a good scrape down, and then,
            gently, gradually but thoroughly beat in the rest of the flour mixture. </li>
        <li>Once everything’s smoothly combined, start beating in the milk, one cautious tablespoon at a time (you
            shouldn’t need more than 3) until your batter drops easily off the beaters, paddle or wooden spoon when
            lifted up out of the bowl. </li>
        <li>Divide the cake batter evenly between the two prepared tins, and smooth the tops a little. Place side by
            side in the oven and bake for 20–25 minutes, or until the deep burnished gold tops of the cakes are
            delicately springy to the touch and a cake tester comes out clean. </li>
        <li>Take them out of the oven and leave on a cooling rack for 10 minutes before turning them out and removing
            the parchment. Choose which cake you want on top — generally when I bake, I choose the thicker cake for the
            bottom layer, but with a Victoria Sponge, I go for the one which I think will look most appealing — and
            place that layer with the top uppermost to stop the rack leaving an impression. The bottom layer should be
            cooled top-side down, so as to help diminish any doming. Allow the cakes to cool completely. If needed, you
            can keep the cooled cakes on the wire rack, draped with a clean tea towel, for a couple of hours before
            sandwiching.
        </li>
        <li>When you are ready to serve the cake, put the bottom layer on its serving plate, top side down, so that you
            are sandwiching the two flat sides together. Beat the jam in a cup or small bowl, just to make it easier to
            spread, and then duly spread it over the waiting cake. </li>
        <li>Put the raspberries onto a plate and lightly fork to crush them a little and add them evenly to the layer of
            jam. </li>
        <li>Whip the cream until it’s thick but still with a little softness to it, and spread it gently over the jam
            and fruit. Place your second cake on top, and then sprinkle over the 2 teaspoons of sugar to give the cake a
            light, sparkly dusting. Eat immediately and with joy in your heart. </li>
